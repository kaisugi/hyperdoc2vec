Named Entity Disambiguation (NED)
refers to the task of resolving multiple
named entity mentions in a document to
their correct references in a knowledge
base (KB) (e.g., Wikipedia). In this paper,
we propose a novel embedding method
specifically designed for NED. The proposed method jointly maps words and entities into the same continuous vector space.
We extend the skip-gram model by using two models. The KB graph model
learns the relatedness of entities using the
link structure of the KB, whereas the anchor context model aims to align vectors
such that similar words and entities occur
close to one another in the vector space
by leveraging KB anchors and their context words. By combining contexts based
on the proposed embedding with standard
NED features, we achieved state-of-theart accuracy of 93.1% on the standard
CoNLL dataset and 85.2% on the TAC
2010 dataset.
